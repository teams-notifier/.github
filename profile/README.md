## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

Welcome to the Teams Notifier project, a set of services and API to interact with MS Teams, posting, updating and removing messages in a secure maner.

Take a look at the project's site [https://teams-notifier.github.io/](https://teams-notifier.github.io/) and to the [doc](https://teams-notifier.github.io/docs/)

Usable directly through the [`activity-api`](https://github.com/teams-notifier/activity-api) or with dedicated integrations like:
- GitLab with [gitlab-mr-api](https://github.com/teams-notifier/gitlab-mr-api)
- Jira with [jira-api](https://github.com/teams-notifier/jira-api)
